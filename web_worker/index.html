  <h2>Async Web Worker</h2>

  <button class="btn">Main Thread Task 1</button>
  <button class="btn">Worker Task 2</button>
  <button class="btn">Worker Task 3</button>

  <p>
    The main thread is where a browser processes user events and paints. By default, the browser uses a single thread
    to run all the JavaScript in your page, as well as to perform layout, reflows, and garbage collection. This means
    that long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user
    experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unless intentionally using a web worker, such as a service worker, JavaScript runs on the main thread, so it's easy
    for a script to cause delays in event processing or painting. The less work required of the main thread, the more
    that thread can respond to user events, paint, and generally be responsive to the user.
